# Lab Environment Setup

This directory contains all the files and configurations needed to set up a virtual lab environment using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansible. The setup automates the installation of Docker and Docker Compose across multiple nodes, simplifying the management of users and roles.

For a detailed guide on how this environment was created, along with step-by-step instructions, check out the full post [here](https://jglsung.github.io/posts/building-lab-environment/).

Feel free to explore, clone, and adapt the configurations to fit your own projects :)!
